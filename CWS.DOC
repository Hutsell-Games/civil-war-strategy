===========================================================
 1.1   Introduction
===================
The VGA Civil War Strategy Game is a 1 or 2-player graphic
strategic level wargame of the American Civil War. The game
requires VGA. It is provided "as is" without any warranty of
any kind. It has been tested on several types of IBM
compatibles (from XT to 386) but it is impossible to try all
the many combinations of equipment that exist.

The object of the game is to accumulate as many victory
points as possible. The game is played in turns of 2 months
during which both sides perform their actions. Decisions are
made using menus which are described below.

 1.2   Requirements
===================
The program requires the following files:
CWS.EXE         - the game program
CWS.CFG         - your customizable configuration file
CWS.INI         - initialization data file
CWSLEAD.DAT     - army leader data file
CITIES.GRD      - city data file
CWSDOC.COM      - online help file
CWS.DOC         - this documentation file
HISCORE.CWS     - high score file

In addition, the program uses the following files for
graphical effects:
FACE1.VGA       -|
FACE2.VGA        |
FACE3.VGA        |-- for setting difficulty level
FACE4.VGA        |
FACE5.VGA       -|
FORT0.VGA       -|
FORT1.VGA        |-- level of fortification
FORT2.VGA       -|
MTN.VGA         - mountain icons

If the History option is ON (see Utility menu below), the
following files are created:
BATTSUMM        - summary of battles and losses in the war
CWS.HIS         - chronicle of battles, winners, losers, and
                  losses; can be viewed using the Recap
                  option in the Inform menu (see below).

 1.3  Running the Game
======================
Type 'CWS' at the command line prompt. The title screen
display will appear while the game initializes. You can skip
opening music and graphics by typing 'CWS Q' at the command
line prompt.


				- 2  -
 
The option to load a game or begin a new game is given at
the beginning of the game, in addition to being available
during the game.

 1.4  How to Win
================
You are awarded victory points for (1) capturing cities, (2)
capturing armies, (3) winning battles, and (4) special
events. Each city you control gives you a certain number of
victory points (and a like amount of income). This varies
depending on the city. For instance, a large city such as
Philadelphia is worth much more than a smaller city such as
Fort Donelson. To see the number of victory points each city
is worth, use the "Inform" option to access the "Cities"
report.

Capital cities are worth an additional bonus of 50 victory
points in addition to the normal victory points. If you lose
your capital, you permanently lose the bonus income. If your
capital is threatened, you may move it if you have enough
money, via the "Utility" option of the Main Menu.

If your army defeats an enemy that has no route for retreat
or causes enough casualties to crush the enemy, you capture
the army and receive a bonus of 25 victory points.
Eliminating the enemy fleet also results in bonus victory
points.

For each battle you win, you receive 1 victory point.

Under some circumstances, special events (such as the
Emancipation Proclamation or Lincoln being re-elected)
result in extra victory points for one side or the other.

If the Union does not crush the Rebels, the South will win
by default after a period of time (determined by end game
conditions). When this happens, the score for both sides is
reduced to 70% of the original level.

As play progresses, the score will not instantly track the
performance on battlefield, but rather will "lag" slightly.

The game continues until one side achieves an end game
condition. (See End Game Conditions under the "Utility"
submenu). The side that triggers the end of the game
receives an additional bonus of 100 victory points.

If your score is one of the top 5 scores for the side
played, you name and score are entered into the high score
file.

When the game is over, you are returned to the opening
screen, with the option to quit, load a game or begin a new
game.

 1.5   Map Display
==================
The title screen will clear and a map of the eastern U.S.
will appear along with a menu entitled 'Main'. This is the
Main Menu from which you choose most of your options. Above
the menu is a flag showing which side is currently selected,
Union or Confederate. At the very top of the screen on the
right is a bar graph which shows how the current side is
doing, along with information on victory points and level of
difficulty.

The small colored circles on the map display are cities or
other key locations. There are a total of 40 such locations.
Blue circles are Union controlled; gray ones are Confederate
controlled. Red circles are neutral cities (not controlled
by either side). Two of the cities are CAPITAL cities, and
their circle is marked with a small yellow cross. If the
graphics option is ON, the connections between the cities
will be shown by dashed lines.

If the circle representing the city is surrounded by a
HOLLOW BLACK box, it is a FORTIFIED (FORT+)location; if
surrounded by a SOLID BLACK box, the location is HEAVILY
FORTIFIED (FORT++). Any level of fortification tends to
improve resistance to enemy attacks.

A small box appears in the right of the display with the
letters 'PHIL' underneath. This represents the port of
Philadelphia. The city of Philadelphia itself is the right
most circle at the top of the screen. You will see a small
ship icon in the "PHIL" box which represents the Union navy.

Small flag icons appear next to some cities. Each flag
represents an army. Mountain and rivers features are also
shown on the map.

 1.6   Using the Menus
======================
You may move the highlighted menu option by pressing the
"up" and "down" arrow keys. Pressing 'Enter' will select the
currently highlighted option. In most cases, you may exit
from a menu without selecting any option by pressing the
"escape" or "esc" key. In a few cases you must select an
"EXIT" option to leave the menu without selecting any
option.

Hot keys" are provided to speed menu access. The first
letter of each command will immediately select the item
without having to move the menu bar. WARNING: In responding
to city locations, watch out for cities that have the same
first letter. Using the hot key will select the FIRST city
on the menu that begins with the letter you press. If you
wanted to select another, you must use the up/down arrow
keys. Example: You have the option to recruit at either Fort
Donelson or Front Royal, both of which begin with "F". If
you press "F", Fort Donelson will be selected because it
comes first alphabetically in the menu list. If you want to

				- 4  -
 
select Front Royal in this case, you must use the arrow
keys. If there had been no other cities beginning with "F"
except for Front Royal the hot key would have worked fine.

Note that some menu items have had to be changed slightly to
avoid duplicate first letters. For instance, "Inform" has
replaced the earlier "Reports" menu item because there is
already a menu item on the main menu beginning with "R"
(Railroad).

The menu cursor placement has been made more consistent for
the Option and Utility menus. The cursor now stays on the
submenu if there are more choices available for the item
currently being selected (e.g., more troops to be drilled).
Otherwise it returns to the main menu and stays on the
Option or Utility item.

PLEASE NOTE: TO RETURN TO THE MAIN MENU FROM EITHER THE
COMMANDS OR UTILITY MENU, PRESS THE "ESCAPE" KEY ("Esc").

 1.7   Menu for Railroad and Capital Moves
==========================================
The move-to menu for train moves and capital relocation
responds to the letter of the destination city as well as
the up and down arrow keys. The city that will be displayed
will be the FIRST (alphabetically) friendly city beginning
with the letter you type. For instance, if you wish to move
the army in Vicksburg by train to Charleston, SC, type "C",
and the first friendly city beginning with "C" will show. If
Chattanooga is friendly, it will be displayed. You can then
quickly use the arrow keys to display the desired
destination.

 1.8   Screen Saver
===================
+=========================================================+
|  There is a SCREEN SAVER accessed by pressing "Ctrl-B". |
|  (The "B" may be either upper or lower case).           |
|  The screen will instantly blank and random geometric   |
|  designs will appear.                                   |
+---------------------------------------------------------+
|  To restore the game map, press "Ctrl-B" again.         |
+=========================================================+

 1.9   Set Up
=============
There are several setup options available which can be
accessed from the "UTILITY" option of the Main Menu. You can
swap sides, select 1- or 2-player options, control sound and
graphic options, and adjust difficulty. When you save a
game, the configuration file is automatically updated to the
current set of options you have chosen.

 1.10  Sequence of Play
=======================
Play proceeds in the following sequence for each game turn

				- 5  -
 
(representing 2 months):

  A. Decision Phase
      Side 1 Decisions
             (Union if 2 players ; Human if 1 player)
             1. Recruit
             2. Naval Actions (Resolved Immediately)
             3. Move Orders
             4. Other Decisions (Combine, Fortify, etc.)

      Side 2 Decisions
             (Rebel if 2 players ; Computer if 1 player)
             1. Recruit
             2. Naval Actions (Resolved Immediately)
             3. Move Orders
             4. Other Decisions (Combine, Fortify, etc.)

  B. Move & Combat Update Phase
             (Move Orders Carried Out)

===========================================================
 2.1   Movement
===============
Movement is from city to city (point-to-point movement) by
armies. Any number of friendly armies may stack in a city.
Armies that move to a city occupied by an enemy army must
fight the enemy, and either drive off the enemy (to capture
the city) or be forced back themselves.

The move-to-menu for army moves has been enhanced when the
currently selected city on the menu is occupied by another
army (enemy or friendly). In that event, the name of the
occupying army is shown in place of the city name on the
highlighted menu line. Underneath the menu box, the strength
of the occupying army is also displayed.

NOTE: If there is more than one army in an occupied city
that another army is viewing to move to, the name and
strength of only one army is shown. You will need to consult
use INFORM option to determine all the armies in that
particular city.

Moving into an enemy city that is not occupied by an army
results in automatic capture of the city. Movement into a
neutral city automatically captures the neutral city. The
city will change colors to indicate you have gained control.

Fighting to capture an occupied fortified city reduces the
fortification by one level. (Thus, a FORTIFIED+ city would
be reduced to an unfortified city.)

				- 6  -
 

When an army captures an unoccupied fortified city, the fort
is not necessarily reduced. The victorious army is given the
option to raze the fortifications. Note that razing TOTALLY
destroys the forts, even if they were double fortified.

 2.2   Armies
=============
Armies have several attributes of importance. These will
change as the game progresses, and it is important for you
to understand how they influence the outcomes.

STRENGTH   - the number of men in the unit; the prime
             attribute in combat

LEADER     - ability score of the unit leader, from 1 to 10.
             Greatly affects the unit's effectiveness in
             battle and movement.

EXPERIENCE - the number of battles the unit has won (0-10).
             More experienced units are more effective in
             combat. Each battle won increases the
             experience level by 1.

SUPPLY     - the current state of food and equipment (0-10).
             Units use 1 unit of supply each turn, except in
             summer and autumn harvest months. Capturing
             cities and capturing enemy armies increases
             supply. Moving and fighting accelerate use of
             supplies. Units that are 'out of supply'
             (supply level=0) fight at 50% effectiveness,
             and move more slowly. Units that are out of
             supply are now marked with an "S" to make them
             easier to locate. Armies in port cities are
             always in supply if the city is not blockaded.

This menu shows the primary decisions you can make. At the
bottom of the menu are symbols that tell you what setup
options are active, and a reminder that F7 is a shortcut
"speed" key to go to the next turn. (WARNING: F7 will take
you to the next turn without asking for confirmation; be
SURE you are through with your moves). The
"music note" symbol tells you that music is ON. 'Snd' tells
you that sound is ON. The "G" symbol tells you that graphics
are ON for combat scenes. The number '1' or '2' tells you
whether this is a 1- or 2-player game.

When graphics are turned ON, the connection links between
cities are shown. Also, there are displays for battles and
special events, such as the surrender of an army. Play will
be slowed slightly by when graphics are ON, due to time
required to draw these displays.

 3.2   Troops (Recruits)
========================
Allows you to recruit new armies or build up existing
armies. Each recruitment requires 100 money units. If you do
not have enough money, you cannot recruit.

You will be given one or more randomly selected cities where
you may recruit (only ones that your side currently
controls). If the city is vacant, a NEW army is placed
there, along with a commander and his corresponding
abilities. Adding recruits to an existing army increases its
strength, but does not change the commander.

Each side has 20 commanders available to lead separate
armies. As the game progresses, the number of available
commanders will be reduced as commanders are captured or are
occupied leading other units.

If the list of 20 preset commanders is exhausted, there is
list of "generic" commanders provided so you can still
recruit and finish the game. Generic units are given Roman
numeral identifiers. For instance, Union army 12 is
designated Union XII. Rebel army 22 is designated Rebel II,
and so forth.

Newly created armies MAY NOT move this turn, while they
train and organize. Existing armies that are increased in
strength CAN MOVE in the current turn.

At the balanced play level, newly created stand-alone armies
are 7,000 men. Additions to existing armies are 4,500 men.
(See REALISM toggle).

Experience level of recruits will be low (varies slightly,
with slightly better levels for Rebel armies).

NOTE: Once you have begin to recruit, you should NOT change
      sides or number of players, since the cities to
      recruit in are already selected for that part of the

				- 8  -
 
      turn.

 3.3   Ships
============
Allows you to build and move fleets and bombard enemy
cities. Each side has one fleet, consisting of 0-10 ships.
Ships can be added to the fleet only in friendly port
cities.

Two type of ships may now be built: wooden ships or
ironclads. Wooden ships cost 100 money units; ironclads cost
200 money units; Ironclads are no more effective than wooden
ships in bombarding cities or conducting invasions. However,
ironclads are superior to wooden ships in ship-to-ship
combat. They are 10% more effective in scoring a hit than a
wooden ship, and they can take 20 hits whereas wooden ships
can only take 10 hits.

As fleets are formed, ironclads are always added to the
left most position in the fleet. Wooden ships are always
added to the rightmost position. When combat or invasions
occur, it proceeds from right to left. This means the ships
to the right are engaged first.

The ship icon displayed on the map is the one corresponding
to the ship type of the first (left most position) in the
fleet. Information on the composition of the enemy fleet can
be found using the Inform option.

Ships can be moved to any port city. This means ships may
move much more rapidly than armies, but their effect is
different.

If the two fleets meet in a port, they will engage in
combat. During each round of combat, the attacker has the
option to press the attack or retire. Each ship can take 10
enemy hits before it sinks. The current number of hits
remaining is shown below the ship icon. Combat continues
until one fleet either retreats or is eliminated. At the end
of the turn, there can be only one fleet in a given port.

Ships do not transport armies, but can bombard enemy cities
to damage defending armies or fortifications, or to drive
the city to neutrality. If the city has an enemy army, the
bombardment will damage the enemy. The fleet will also
blockade the enemy army in the port, reducing his supplies.
Fortified cities may have the forts damaged or reduced.
However, forts may sink attacking ships.

Unfortified cities not occupied by a defending army may
become neutral as a result of the bombardment.

Note that both human and computer players are now prohibited
from moving to a port and attacking the port on the same
turn.


				- 9  -
 
 3.4   Invasions
================
The realism toggle also affects the ability for seaborne
units to conduct invasions.

If the realism toggle is ON, the Union player ONLY
may conduct invasions. Otherwise, BOTH sides may conduct
invasions.

Invasions may be conducted only at neutral cities if there
is more than one ship in the invading fleet. The fleet size
will be reduced by 1 and the new army will seize the neutral
city, under the leadership of the next available commander.
The invading army is small (3500 men) and vulnerable to
attack. However, the captured city is eligible for possible
recruiting later.

 3.5   Raid Commerce
====================
Ships from both sides have the option to raid enemy commerce
on the high seas. This is shown as the "Raid" option on the
Ships menu. Selecting this option will cause a red box to
appear, with the word "Commerce" in it, along with the ship
icon. Each turn that the fleet stays in this box, there is a
probability of doing damage to the enemy by destroying
commerce and thereby reducing his income. There is also a
chance that one or more of the raiding ships will be sunk.
If both fleets enter the commerce raiding zone, combat will
occur and one fleet will either be destroyed or have to
retreat. Only one fleet can remain in this zone at the end
of the turn. It is that fleet which can attempt to raid
enemy commerce.

 3.6   Move Orders
==================
Allows you to select an army to move and where to move it. A
menu will cycle through all your armies that are able to
move this turn. Armies that already have move orders, or
that have been combined this turn, or that have built
fortifications this turn, or newly created armies are not
eligible to move in the current turn.

Once you select the army to move, the choice of all possible
connecting destinations for that army are shown. Selecting a
destination will result in a white dotted line from the
selected unit to the destination. Note that the army does
not move immediately. Rather, it will attempt to move during
the move and update phase.

If an army with move orders is attacked during the move and
update phase, there is a chance that it will not be able to
carry out those orders. If it is defeated, it must retreat,
but even if it wins it may have its orders cancelled.

During the month of January, you may not carry out any land
campaigns (i.e., attack enemy or neutral cities). You may

				- 10  -
 
move armies to friendly cities, fortify, or conduct other
land operations. Naval operations are unaffected by the
January restriction.

 3.7   Railroad
===============
Both sides have access to railroads to rapidly move 1 army
per side from a friendly city to another. In order to use
the railroad, it must not already be in use by an army on
this turn. In order to be an origin or  destination for a
railroad move, a city has to join with at least 2 other
friendly cities.  Both terminals must be part of a "chain"
of least 3 connected friendly cities. (In earlier versions,
a "chain" of 2 friendly cities was considered a valid origin
or destination). In other words, neither terminal can be cut
off" by the enemy. Once selected, railroad moves can NOT be
cancelled.

The Union railroad can carry an army up to 60,000 men. The
Rebel railroad can carry an army up to 30,000 men. (These
values can be adjusted in the configuration file and will
vary somewhat if the REALISM toggle is on). The current
railroad capacity for your side is shown at the bottom of
the screen. There is no cost for the rail movement. Note
that to be eligible to move by rail, an army may not have
other move orders, nor may it have used its turn in any
other way (such as in fortifying a city).

When an army is placed on the railroad, a small train icon
of appropriate color will appear in the box in the upper
left corner of the screen. The destination for railroad
moves is shown in the railroad box. If you are playing a
2-player game, your opponent will know  you have an army on
the train, but will not know its destination. The arrival of
armies moved by rail for BOTH sides takes place at the
BEGINNING of the move and combat phase. Thus, armies
transported by rail will appear at their destinations BEFORE
any other land moves or attacks are made.

 3.8   Next Turn
================
When you have completed your decisions for the current turn,
select this option to continue with the game sequence. Note
that once the game sequence progresses, you cannot back up.
Thus, when you select this option, you will be asked to
confirm before the turn actually progresses.

 3.9   Inform (Reports)
=======================
Seven different reports are potentially available; there is
no cost for any of the reports.

  1) Friendly Army report
       Shows the status of all your armies, and other useful
       statistics on the progress of the game. After the
       first turn, it will also show the total strength of

				- 11  -
 
       the enemy forces.

  2) Enemy Army report
       Shows information similar to Friendly army report,
       except that it shows less complete information on the
       enemy forces. It includes the composition of the
       enemy navy.

  3) City report
       Provides information on the cities, their worth,
       status, and so on.

  4) Force summary
       Shows on the map the strength of all armies (in 100's
       of men).

  5) Intelligence report
       Provides an on-map summary of attributes of all
       FRIENDLY armies (strength, leadership, experience,
       and supply).

  6) Battle Summary report
       Shows number of battles won and casualties incurred
       for each side.

  7) Recap report (if HISTORY option is ON in the Utility
     menu)
       Scrolls you through a chronicle of the history of the
       game thus far (battle outcomes and losses)

     Typical chronicle entries might look like this:

     Manassas *Lee (3200/29600) defeats McDowell (5400/30200)
     Memphis  Pope (1000/9900) defeats *Johnston (2900/12400)

     The asterisk indicates the attacker. Casualties and
     total troop strength are indicated in the parentheses.

 3.10  Commands
===============
See Commands Submenu for a description of the choices. These
generally relate to special commands available for
individual armies.

 3.11  Utility
==============
See Utility Submenu. These provide game options that allow
various features of overall game play to be modified.

 3.12  Files
============
Allows you to load or save games and to quit then program.
There can be up to 9 saved games,"CWSx.SAV", where "x" is
a number from 1 to 9. Those file names for which a saved
game exists are marked with a "û" as a reminder.


				- 12  -
 
When the game is started, the base game is automatically
initialized, configured according to the current CWS.CFG
settings.

                     | MAIN MENU  |
                     +============+

 5.2   Cancel
=============
Allows the move orders for unit selected (menu with eligible
units will be displayed) to be cancelled - in case you
change your mind before you go to the next turn.

 5.3   Fortify
==============
If ALL the following conditions are met, you may fortify a
city:
1. City is occupied by a friendly army
2. City is not already at DOUBLE FORTIFIED ++ level
3. You have at least 200 money units


				- 13  -
 
All cities meeting these conditions, will appear in a menu
of candidates. Selecting a city to fortify will cause the
city icon to be updated on the game display. The army
occupying a city that is fortified loses its turn (it is
presumably busy building fortifications) and will be shown
as 'Resting' in the Army report.

An army may increase a given city's fortifications by 1
level per turn. If there are 2 units in a city, each army
may add 1 level of fortification in a turn, thereby double
fortifying the city.

 5.4   Join (Combine)
=====================
Up to a certain level, friendly armies may be combined to
create larger and more powerful forces. In order to combine,
armies must start the turn stacked in the same city. Stacked
armies are indicated by a small gold circle on the flag
icon. Selecting 'Combine' will result in a menu of candidate
cities in which armies are stacked. Selecting a city will
cause all armies in that city to attempt to combine, up to a
maximum level of 125,000 men. Army attributes for combined
armies are averaged, and the best commander of the armies
combined will assume leadership of the combined forces. (His
leadership ability will be reduced slightly to account for
the increased difficulty of commanding the larger forces.)

 5.5   Supply
=============
On occasion, you may need to manually allocate additional
provisions to units that are out of supply. These units may
be seen on the map marked with an "S" to make them easier to
locate. At the end of the move and update phase, units will
automatically receive 1 unit of supply, assuming enough
money is available. Automatic update of supply costs .002
money units per 1,000 men in the army unit. (For instance, a
22,000 man unit would require 44 money units to resupply).
This automatic resupply is done in numerical unit sequence,
so that higher numbered units are supplied last. If there is
not enough money to supply all units, or if the unit expends
more than expected supplies, or is blockaded in a port, some
will eventually get out of supply. Note that in the months
of July and September, units are resupplied without cost
(except for blockaded units).

To manually resupply, you must have enough money to provide
the supplies, which depends on the size of the army being
resupplied. Each unit of supply requires .001 money units
1,000 men (cheaper that automatic resupply). However, the
computer will attempt to allocate as much supply as possible
to the unit selected, up to a maximum of 5 units of supply.
If you do not have enough money to allocate at least 1 unit
of supply, none will be provided.

 5.6   Move Capital - ADVANCED FEATURE
======================================

				- 14  -
 
You may move your capital (if it has not yet been captured)
for a cost of 500 money units. Moving the capital also
results in awarding your enemy 50 victory points. However,
it may help keep the enemy from capturing the capital, which
normally will end the game. Use the up/down arrow keys until
the desired city is shown for the new capital location (only
the current candidate city is shown in the  menu). When the
desired city for the new capital appears, press Enter.

 5.7   Detach - ADVANCED FEATURE
================================
The Rebel player ONLY may detach a unit from an existing
army, provided the original army is large enough (6,500 men
or more) and there is an available Rebel commander for the
detached unit. 30% of the original force is split into the
new unit, along with 30% of the supplies.

 5.8   Drill - ADVANCED FEATURE
===============================
Both sides may drill armies to increase their experience
level. Drilling requires one turn in which the army cannot
move. Experience gained in this manner cannot exceed the
leader's command rating, and is limited to a maximum of 5 in
any case.

 5.9   Relieve - ADVANCED FEATURE
=================================
The Relieve option allows you to replace generals, thereby
removing them from their command. (This is, of course, quite
historical as Lincoln and Davis both exercised this option
several times). To be RELIEVED, a unit cannot have already
used its turn (e.g., cannot have move orders). When a
general is relieved, you are allowed to replace him with
another general from the list of available commanders. When
a general is relieved, the unit uses its turn, and suffers
two additional penalties. Both the EXPERIENCE level and the
LEADERSHIP level of the unit are decreased by 1 because of
confusion about the new leader's style of command. The
relieved general is placed on the list of available
commanders, awaiting possible future service.

 6.2   Side
===========
Toggles between the Union and Rebel side for the 1 player
game only.

 6.3   Solo/2-Player
====================
Toggles between 1- and 2- player game.

 6.4   Graphics
===============
Adjust level of graphics. Four levels of graphics are now
allowed, designated G0 through G3.

   G0  = no additional graphics (BASIC level)
   G1  = show city connections
   G2  = show city connections and city names
   G3  = show city connections, city names, and additional
         combat graphics

   Higher graphics levels will slow the game somewhat while
   the screen is redrawn.

 6.5   Sound
============
Toggle between Sound & Music, Sound Only, and Quiet.

 6.6   Display
==============
Sets display speed for messages displayed, from fast to very
slow.

 6.7   Balance
==============
Set Play Balance from Rebel++ (large Rebel advantage) all
the way to Union++ (large Union advantage). Play balance
affects the relative resources allocated, along with the
handicap received in combat.

 6.8   End Game Conditions
==========================
Shows the conditions that will determine when the game is
over. These are specified in the input file CWS.INI, and can
be changed by changing that file. Up to 5 different preset
conditions may trigger the end of the game:

                Time (Month & Year)

				- 16  -
 
                % Cities Controlled by Either Side
                % Income for Either Side
                Capital Capture By Either Side *
                Ratio of Total Army Strength

In addition, the total elimination of either side's armies
will trigger a victory condition. Active conditions are
marked with an "û". These may be toggled either off or on
(active) using this option by pressing ENTER when the
desired condition is highlighted, but the VALUES themselves
can only be changed in CWS.INI (see "Files" section below).
If ANY of the active conditions are achieved by EITHER SIDE,
the game will end. If there are NO active end game
conditions, the game will continue indefinitely.

* Note: If BOTH sides lose their capital in the same turn,
  the game does NOT end even if this condition is active.

 6.9  Victory Condition Override
================================
There is an override option when victory conditions signal
the end of the game. This allows you to keep playing if you
choose instead of abruptly ending the game. Each time the
override is used it increases the victory condition that was
triggered. For example, suppose the % cities controlled
condition is triggered. Suppose it is currently set at 32
(80% of total), and that the end game condition is
overridden. The number of cities required to trigger the
condition is increased to 33 (or 82.5%). If it is overridden
later, it increases to 34 (85%) and so on.

 6.10 Random Events
===================
Control over random events has been extended in the Utility
menu option. Random events can be toggled OFF so they do not
occur. If random events are ON, the degree to which they
favor one side or the other can be controlled:

    Favor Union  (70% of random events help the Union)
    Neutral (50% help the Union; 50% help the Rebels)
    Favor Rebels (70% of random events help the Rebels)

If random events are ON in a 1-player game, they will
default in favor of the computer opponent if they are not

 6.11 Vary Start
================
Selecting this option at the beginning of the game will
give different starting conditions.

 6.12 January Campaigns
=======================
Toggle to allow/disallow January campaigns.

 6.13 Realism Toggle
====================

				- 17  -
 
A toggle is provided in the Utility menu ("REALISM") to
control several aspects of the game. The specific effects
are listed below.

   a) When the REALISM toggle is ON, the number of possible
      recruits depends on size of city in which recruiting
      is taking place instead of a fixed number of recruits.
      The city size is as represented by the income level in
      the CITIES.GRD file.

      When the toggle is OFF, the number of recruits for new
      or existing armies is fixed at the levels in the basic
      game (7000 for new armies; 4500 for additions to
      existing armies). This number is fixed regardless of
      whether recruiting is done in larger cities (e.g.,
      Philadelphia) or smaller cities (e.g., Fort Donelson).
      Likewise, any city currently controlled is potentially
      available as a source for recruits (e.g., Rebels
      recruiting in Philadelphia).

      When the realism toggle is ON, the number of recruits
      varies based on the value assigned to the city in the
      CITIES.GRD data file. For cities with values in the
      10-15 range, the number of recruits will be about the
      same as with the toggle off. However, the number of
      recruits will be larger than normal for bigger cities
      and smaller than normal in smaller cities.

   b) When REALISM is ON, recruiting cannot take place in
      cities that were ORIGINALLY under enemy control. Thus,
      if realism is ON, recruits may be raised only in
      cities that were ORIGINALLY friendly or neutral. This
      will prohibit Union recruits being raised in say, New
      Orleans or Rebel troops being recruited in
      Philadelphia.

   c) When a city is completely isolated the number of
      troops available for recruiting within that city is
      reduced to 1/3 the normal level.

   d) When the REALISM switch is ON, the railroad capacity
      is variable, based on number of cities held. At the
      beginning of the game, capacity for both sides will be
      the initial level set in the CWS.CFG file. However,
      for each additional city captured, the capacity will
      increase by 5,000 troops. (Conversely, for each
      additional city lost, the capacity will decrease by
      5,000 troops). However, the capacity will not exceed
      twice the initial level, nor fall below half the
      initial level.

   e) The realism toggle also affects the ability for
      seaborne units to conduct invasions (see invasions).
      When the REALISM toggle is ON, only the Union side may
      conduct invasions.


				- 18  -
 
   f) When REALISM is ON, the defender combat advantage is
      increased. This will make it harder for the Rebels to
      make excursions into Ohio and the like. However,
      history makes it very clear that the defensive
      posture was extremely powerful in the war.

  (g) When REALISM is ON, ironclads cannot be built prior
      to 1862, to be more historically correct.

 6.14 Check Links
=================
A utility has been provided to check for return routes on
maps that you design yourself. For instance, if you have a
link from Manassas to Harpers Ferry but not from Harpers
Ferry to Manassas, there is missing return route. This
option is accessed by the 'Chk Links' option on the UTILITY
menu. Missing return route links are identified, and if
possible, corrected for current game being played. Note: the
CITIES.GRD data file is not fixed; the user must note the
corrections and make them via a text editor.

 6.15 Enemy Aggression
======================
This option applies only for 1-player game. By repeated
selecting this option you may cycle through enemy
aggressiveness levels from 0 (least aggressive) to 5 (most
aggressive). The default level is 1. At the lower levels,
the enemy will be more cautious and defensive, preferring to
build forts and make attacks only when the odds are
favorable. At the higher levels, the enemy will attack more
often, perhaps even to the point of foolhardiness.

===========================================================
 7      M O V E    &    C O M B A T    P H A S E
===========================================================
 7.1    Computer Decisions
==========================
If you are playing a 1-player game versus the computer, you
will see the computer decisions being made. The computer
does not 'cheat' by taking advantage of knowledge of the
moves you have selected.  If the side played by the computer
has an advantage in play balance, it will be a more
difficult opponent because it will get more resources, and
will receive a combat handicap.

You will be prompted to "press any key for month /year
events". During the update phase, the message "UPDATE" will
appear in the lower right of the map area. The computer will
move the armies, provide information on battles, state of
supplies, and so on. From time to time the display will
pause to give you time to read the messages. You can press
any key to move on.

 7.2   Army Movement
====================
When you see the message "press any key for (current month

				- 19  -
 
and year) events", the move and update phase has begun.
During this phase both sides have their move orders carried
out. When enemy armies meet in the same city, combat occurs.
After combat, only one side will continue to occupy the
city. The side that was driven off loses the battle.

+==========================================================+
| The rail movement for BOTH sides takes place at the      |
| BEGINNING of the move and combat phase. Thus, armies     |
| being transported by rail will appear in their           |
| destinations BEFORE any other army movement takes place. |
+==========================================================+

The order in which armies move depends on (1) ability of the
leader (better ones tend to move first), (2) supply (out of
supply units move last) and (3) a random factor. Armies
carry out their orders one at a time. The flag icon will
move from the starting location to the destination city.

 7.3   Combat
=============
If combat occurs, a set of statistics will appear on the
right of the screen giving important information on how the
battle will be resolved. The information for both attacker
and defender begins with a base calculation, which goes
through a series of adjustments to arrive at a final value
for this battle.

   Item       Meaning
----------  -----------------------------------------------

 Base       Base combat strength, obtained by dividing unit
            strength by 10,000 and rounding up. Thus, an
            army with 23,000 men has a base combat strength
            of 3. The base for defenders is increased to
            account for their reduced exposure to fire.

 Ldr/Exp    Base combat strength, adjusted for leadership
            and experience. Armies outmanned by more than
            5:1 will usually not receive this adjustment.
            However, elite armies with experience levels of
            8 or more automatically receive a bonus, even if
            hopelessly outnumbered.

 Small      Adjusted strength after penalizing for very
            small forces (i.e., small force has less than
            1,500 men).

 Outman     Additional adjustment if the opposing army is
            much larger than this army proportionately. This
            occurs for the attacker if outnumbered by more
            than 5:1 or for the defender if outnumbered by
            more than 10:1.

 Supply     Additional adjustment if unit is out of supply
            (will be in contrasting color). Out-of-supply

				- 20  -
 
            units fight at half strength.

 Difclt     Additional adjustment based on difficulty level.

 Fort       (FOR DEFENDERS ONLY) - Additional adjustment if
            location is fortified and defender has not moved
            or fought previously in this turn. NOTE:
            Occasionally an exceptional commander will get
            the fort bonus even if he has fought previously
            in the turn.

The exact combat adjustment for outmanned armies has been is
shown below:
+-------------------------+---------------+---------------+
| Attacker/Defender Ratio |  Attack Adjust| Defend Adjust |
+=========================+===============+===============+
|     1:10 or worse       | set to 1 (min)|set to 20 (max)|
+-------------------------+---------------+---------------+
|     1:10 to  1:5        | set to 1 (min)|     + 2       |
+-------------------------+---------------+---------------+
|     1:5  to  1:2        |      - 2      |     + 2       |
+-------------------------+---------------+---------------+
|     1:2  to  2:1        |        0      |       0       |
+-------------------------+---------------+---------------+
|     2:1  to  3:1        |        0      |     - 2       |
+-------------------------+---------------+---------------+
|     3:1  to  5:1        |      + 2      |     - 2       |
+-------------------------+---------------+---------------+
|     5:1  to 10:1        |      + 2      | set to 1 (min)|
+-------------------------+---------------+---------------+
|     10:1 or better      |set to 20 (max)| set to 1 (min)|
+-------------------------+----------------+--------------+
Note that this is in addition to any other combat
adjustments, such as leadership, fortification, supply, etc.


All combat adjustments are made sequentially, and the final
result is the one actually used in the combat calculations.
The final result for both the Attacker and the Defender is
shown in a highlighted box. The final values can never be
less than 1 nor more than 20. A calculation of the odds of
an attacker victory are also given as A GUIDE ONLY. The
computer actually resolves the combat separately from this
calculation of attacker odds, but it should provide a good
indicator of who is likely to win the battle.

The actual results of the battle will be displayed after you
press a key. The winner is announced at the bottom of the
screen. Casualty information (numbers and percentages for
each side) are shown at the top of the screen. Notice that
an army can win the battle but suffer greater losses than
the enemy.

The loser must retreat to an adjacent friendly city. The
human player is given the option as to which city to retreat
to if a player-controlled DEFENDING army must retreat (if

				- 21  -
 
there is more than one choice for retreat). If there are no
retreat options, the loser will surrender. Even if there is
a retreat option, a unit may be so outnumbered and reduced
in size so much that it can no longer function. Such
shattered units will also surrender. When units surrender,
their commanders are PERMANENTLY removed from the game.

If there is more than one defending army in a city, the
attacker must defeat each defender one at a time until all
defenders are driven out before occupying the city.

 7.4   Income Update
====================
After all combat and moves are resolved, the supplies are
distributed, and income and victory points are updated based
on present game situations. Note that the Union side always
receives income from other parts of the country outside the
region shown (e.g., Boston, New York, Chicago, etc.) Thus,
the Union in effect has an income bonus. Supplies are
distributed based on cash remaining, to the armies in
numerical order.

 8.1   Alternate Map
====================
There is an alternate game setup in the ALTMAP files, as
follows:

   ALTMAP.GRD is the alternate map grid
   ALTMAP.INI is the alternate initialization file
   ALTLEAD.DAT is the alternate leadership file

A batch file ALTMAP.BAT will automatically switch these
alternate files with the game files so they can be used by the
program. To run this file, at your DOS prompt, simply type
 ALTMAP
To switch them back, run ALTMAP.BAT a second time.

===========================================================
 9.1   Initialization File (CWS.INI)
====================================
The data files are simple "flat ASCII" files and may be
customized as you wish to change game conditions. (It is
good practice to copy the original as a backup before you
create a new one.) The program probably will not run if you
make errors in these files.

Examples of the actual data lines are shown below in the
boxed areas; comment lines before each of the data lines
describe the information in that line.

 9.3   City Matrix (CITIES.GRD)
===============================
Unless you are very experienced, don't change this file.
Even if you are experienced, you should make a back up copy.
Please note: Cities MUST be in alphabetical order based on
the city abbreviations used; the program depends on this
order for army movement, fortification identification, and
other options. STRANGE things may happen if your cities are
not alphabetized. There must be exactly 40 cities.

Format:
        City #,
        x VGA coordinate (1-530),
        y coordinate (16-440),
        city name (text),
        which side initially possesses
           (0=neutral, 1=Union, 2= Rebel)
        income value (0-99)
        next 6 numbers indicate which cities this connects
           with
        port indicator (0=not a port, 99=port city),
                         fortification level (0-2))

 10.1 Combat Model Adjustment
=============================
The combat model has been made more "open" to allow more
user customization. Three key combat factors are specified
in the CWS.INI file (on the starting cash position line -
see the DATA FILES section for specific information).

  ATKFAC - the base attacker casualty rate. Default is 11%.
           This value is adjusted, depending on whether the
           defender is in a fortified position and whether
           the attacker wins.
  DEFAC  - the base defender casualty rate. Default is 9%.
           This value is adjusted, depending on whether the
           defender is in a fortified position and whether
           the defender wins.
  TCR    - the total combat range. Default is 20. This is
           the limit of adjusted combat factors for both
           the attacker and defender. Lower factors than
           20 will tend to make battle outcomes more
           influenced by random factors (luck). Higher
           factors than 20 will increasingly give the edge
           to the stronger army, particularly the one with
           the most troops. A value around 20 will cause
           the stronger side to generally win, but still
           leave enough element of luck that the weaker
           army can occasionally defeat a stronger foe.

 10.2  Game Concept
===================
The game takes a strategic military point of view. There are
essentially 3 theaters of war, the Mississippi River,
central Tennessee, and Virginia. Combat revolves around the
power of defensive (particularly fortified) positions, and
cutting lines of retreat to isolate and capture armies. The
Confederates must move quickly early in the game before
superior Union resources overwhelm them. Likewise, the Union
must press to victory (normally taking the Rebel capital)
before time expires and the Rebels earn a victory by default
as the European powers recognize them.

The game is intended first and foremost to be fun, and is
basically a 2 player game. The computer AI ability is
limited, and results may be quite a historical. The 2-player
option offers more possibilities, but even here, historical
accuracy is not claimed.

 10.3  Victory
==============
The game checks for active victory conditions and
automatically ends when they are met. (You do get a chance
to override if you want to play just a LITTLE longer). You
will get a good indication of how the game is going for your
side from the information in the upper right hand part of
the screen. There is a moving banner line displayed at
screen bottom to warn you when a victory condition is about
to be reached.

Enjoy !
