## Contributing
Please see the [CONTRIBUTING.md](dev/CONTRIBUTING.md) file for instructions on how you can contribute improvements and bug fixes for this game.

## Branches
- I don't remember the state of the `main` branch, it's been a few years since I edited it (lol).
- The current "in development branch" is `canonical+2`.
- canonical is the original DOS source code for the game written by W.R. Hutsell.
    - This branch should NEVER be edited, it is for historical purposes.
- `canonical+1` is the predecessor to `canonical+2`, I attempted to make incremental changes that were unlikely to break things (I think?).

## Licensing
The Civil War Strategy Game is under the [permissive MIT license](../LICENSE). Some additional considerations based on the use of the QB64 compiler are outlined in [CWSTRAT.exe.license.txt](../CWSTRAT.exe.license.txt).
